Scope
=====
This should be observed every time the autoclave indicates it requires a water fill top up.

Responsibilities
================
Care should be taken to not splash water when filling.

The machine itself may be hot and steam released when opening the top vent.
Gloves and eye protection should be worn when performing maintenance on the autoclave.


Materials
=========
The autoclave requires a supply of **RO water**. If the water supply level falls below a minimum level, the operator will be required to top up the system. The RO water is available from the tank under the counter. The autoclave is filled into the tank from the top of the machine.

If there are any problems, please email for `biolab support <mailto:hello@biohackspace.org>`__

Procedures
