LBL biohackspace SOPs
=====================

To build these you will need a very recent version of Pandoc (Debian unstable doesn't cut it at time of writing). Download an installer for your OS here:

You'll also need pdflatex, which is part of texlive, and the texlive fonts.

Then type

make cl1

to build.
