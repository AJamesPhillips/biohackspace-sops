Purpose
=======
The following document describes the procedure for the operation
of the UNICAM Helios Beta Spectrophometer. This instrument is used to measure 
how much light is absorbed by a liquid sample. This 
instrument supports a range of visible and UV wavelengths of light.

Scope
=====

This should be observed every time the Spectrophotometer is used within the LBL BioLab with GMO and non-GMO samples.

Responsibilities
================
-  It is the responsibility of lab users to use this equipment in the manner described in this SOP.
-  This machine emits UV light. The operator should ensure that the cover is down and any access hatches are closed and secure.
-  Parts of the machine can get hot. The user should be aware of this and take precautions.

Suitable hand and eye protection should be worn.

Materials
=========

This machine usese Quartz or plastic **cuvettes** with a optical path of 12mm.

The equipment has replaceable UV and visible light bulbs. If either of the bulbs are not functional please email 
`BSO <hello@biohackspace.org>`__ and report the situation.

Definitions
===========
Cuvette
	A small, transparent vessel into which a sample is placed for testing in the UV/Visible Spectrophotometer.

Procedures
==========
1. The spectrophotometer should be started with good time before it's required as the initialization procedure takes ~15 mins.

2. The user should ensure that the sample cuvette is clean before it is inserted into the device.
3. For OD600 select a FIXED scan type

4. Set the wavelength for 600nm.
5. Run a sample containing a media only, this is used as a reference value.
6. Run the sample that contains the sample to be tested.

7. ensure the machine is switched off after use.
