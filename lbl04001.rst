**1. Purpose**

The following document describes the procedure for the operation
of the UNICAM Helios Beta Spectrophometer.

**2. Scope**

This instrument is used to meaure how much light is absorbed by a
liquid sample. In full working condition this instrument supports
a range of visible and UV wavelengths of light.

**3. Responsibilities**

-  It is the responsibility of lab users to use this equipment in the
   manner described in this SOP.
-  It is the responsibility of lab users to report any incidents or
   technical problems with the equipment
-  It is the responsibility of the lab management to provide
   training, technical support and to ensure compliance with the
   operating procedures.

**4. Materials**

-  Quartz or plastic cuvettes with a optical path of 12mm
-  The equipment has replaceable UV and visible light bulbs

**6. Definitions**

-  Cuvette: A small, transparent quartz vessel. This is what a sample
   is put into for testing in the UV - Visible Spectrophotometer.

**7. Procedures**

-  The spectrophotometer should be started with good time before it's
   required as the initialization procedure takes ~15 mins
-  The user should ensure that the sample cuvette is clean before it
   is inserted into the device.
-  For OD600 select a wavelength for 600nm.
-  run a reference sample of media only sample
-  run the sample cuvette
-  ensure the machine is switched off after use
