Purpose
=======
This SOP deals with storage, handling, and disposal of Ethidium Bromide (EtBr).
EtBr is used for visualisation of agarose gels. It is a powerful mutagen and
must be handled with care.

Scope
=====
This SOP must be consulted whenever EtBr is used in the lab and its procedures must be followed.

Responsibilities
================
The EtBr user is responsible for his or her own safety as well as the safety of
others in the lab. In general, the EtBr user should be very careful with any
solutions of EtBr or solutions containing EtBr.

Materials
=========
None.

Related documents
=================
None.

Definitions
===========
None.

Procedures
==========

Gloves must be worn prior to any application involving EtBr, including opening
vessels containing EtBr, innoculating molten agarose with EtBr, and disposal of
EtBr-contaminated material.

The lab has a designated Ethidium Bromide area. All work with EtBr must be performed in this area.

The Ethidium Bromide area contains glassware (such as flasks) which may be used
for EtBr-related procedures. Do not add anything containing EtBr to any other
glassware.

Storage
-------
EtBr solution is stored in a screw-top bottle. The bottle must remain closed
until EtBr is required, and must be re-closed immediately after use.

Application of EtBr to Molten Agarose
-------------------------------------
EtBr may be added to molten agarose to make a gel suitable for visualisation.

- Transfer the EtBr bottle to the EtBr area. Ready a pipette tip.
- Remove the vessel containing molten agarose from the microwave.
- Wait until the temperature of the molten agarose is below 60 degrees C.
- Unscrew the EtBr bottle, pipette the required amount, immerse the pipette tip in the molten agarose, and add the EtBr.
- Close the EtBr bottle.

Disposal
--------

Solids -- including pipette tips, gloves, and gels -- contaminated with EtBr must be deactivated with bleach. After deactivation, the solids may be disposed of in regular lab waste.

Liquids containing EtBr must be poured into the kill bin.

Cleaning up
-----------
Any surfaces used during the procedure must be wiped with bleach.

EtBr glassware may be cleaned with hot water and detergent and returned to the Ethidium Bromide area.
