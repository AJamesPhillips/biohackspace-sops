Purpose
=======

Even under ideal conditions it is inevitable that accidents will happen.
However if the correct procedure is followed, then spillage incidents should
be handled in a calm and sensible manner, and there should be no increased
risk to safety or containment of microbes.

Scope
=====

This procedure is relevant for all users working with micro organisms in the biolab.
This procedure is applicable to both non-GMO and GMO scenarios.

The microbes that are in use in the biolab are categorized as being unlikely to 
cause human disease in hazard group 1 as Biological Agents, and in the GMO context, of no or negligible risk to 
human health and the environment.

Therefore the primary immediate risk  from spillage are as follows:

- Injury from Broken glassware
- Electric shocks from electrical devices.
- Slipping and falling on wet patches.

It is however imperative that the lab user maintain containment of microbes
particularly GMO, during a spillage, and this document describes the equipment
and procedure available to ensure this is the case.

Responsibilities
================

The lab user is responsible for their own safety and that of others in the 
vicinity during any protocol or procecure they are carrying out.



-  It is the lab user's responsibility to be familiar with these procedures, and be able to deal with a spillage of any microbe they are working with.

-  It is the lab user's responsibility to record the incident in the lab day book.


Materials
=========
The Spill kit is maintained in the lab for use in containing spills. A lab user dealing with a spills should find gloves and eyewear available from lab stock.

The spill kit contains

- A bag of absorbent material such as sand
- Spare gloves
- 2 autoclave bags
- A disinfectant agent such as Dettol
- Household bleach
- bucket for temporary containment of broken glass, absorbent material
- Mop

Procedures
==========

Dealing with a spill
--------------------

#. The operator should be wearing gloves and eye protection and a plastic apron.
#. In the case of spillage, absorbant material should be placed around the spill to prevent further spread.
#. The remainder of the spill should be absorbed into blue roll
#. Once the spill is contained the absorbant material and blue rool should be placed in an autoclave bag and transported to the autoclave.
#. A strong disinfectant such as dettol from the spill kit should be applied to the area of the spill and left for 10 minutes
#. The dettol should be absorbed with blue roll and that material collected in autoclave bags.
#. The waste and sand should then be treated as contaminated waste and processed as per `lbl04006 - Using the Autoclave for Waste Deactivation <lbl04006.rst>`__
#. By now there should be no visible remaining spilled material. But a second stage of disinfection should be performed with bleach, leaving the bleach in contact with the contaminated area for 10 minutes.
#. The bleach should be rinsed off with the mop and plenty of tap water the waste can be disposed of down the drain.
#. The incident should be recorded in the day book

Restocking the spill kit
------------------------

Please contact the BSO to notify which items need to be restocked in the spill kit.
